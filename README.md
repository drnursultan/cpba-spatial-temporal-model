# CPB Wisconsin Modeling

This repository contains the code and data used to investigate the abundance of Colorado Potato Beetles in Wisconsin.

## Project Structure

- `r-scripts/`: R code for modeling, cleaning, and merging data
- `python-scripts/`: Python scripts for extraction and transformation
- `data/raw/`: Original field, crop, and climate data
- `data/processed/`: Merged datasets used for modeling
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration (optional)
- `output/figures/`: Graphs and modeling results

## How to Run

1. Make sure R and Python environments are installed.
2. Run `extract_crop_data.R` to prepare crop data.
3. Run `fit_spamm_model.R` to fit spatial model.
4. Use notebooks for visualization.
